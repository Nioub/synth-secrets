# Synth Secrets

I’m currently reading the fantastic [Synth Secrets](http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/allsynthsecrets.htm) series from **Sound On Sound** magazine, written by Gordon Reid.

I find it a little hard to digest online, so I’m compiling it into EPUB format as I go along.

Obviously none of this content is mine, and if I’m asked to take it down I will. When I’m finished getting through it all I’ll be asking if I can make it freely available somewhere.

### “Works on my device”

I’m using EPUB 3.0, and this works fine in iBooks on the iPad, which is all I care about supporting right now. Your mileage may vary (links within chapters don’t seem to work within Adobe Digital Editions for example).

## Progress

Parts *1-5* are in the EPUB.

## Generating the EPUB

If you want to regenerate the EPUB from this repository for whatever reason:

    git clone https://github.com/grillpanda/synth-secrets.git
    cd epub
    ./rebuild.sh

You’ll need to have **epubcheck** installed to run `rebuild.sh`. You can install it on a Mac with Homebrew.

    brew install epubcheck
