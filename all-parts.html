  <li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may99/articles/synthsec.htm">Part 1: What's In A Sound?</a>
  
  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun99/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 2: The Physics Of Percussion</a><br>
       The first part of this series explained how the tones of most real
       instruments can be reduced to patterns of harmonics, which can be
       generated using sine, saw, square or pulse waveforms. This month, Gordon
       Reid considers the sonic raw materials needed to imitate unpitched
       percussion.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul99/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 3: Modifiers &amp; Controllers</a><br>
       Gordon Reid moves on from discussing the harmonic components of sound to
       explaining how they change over time, and some of the tools subtractive
       synths give you to emulate this process

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug99/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 4: Of Filters &amp; Phase Relationships</a><br>
       Having dealt last month with the concepts of envelopes, oscillators and
       LFOs, Gordon Reid moves on to the subject of filters, and the havoc they
       wreak on the signals that pass through them.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep99/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 5: Further With Filters</a><br>
       Gordon Reid continues his series on the theory of subtractive synthesis
       by delving deeper into the amazingly complex world of the analogue audio
       filter.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct99/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 6: Of Responses And Resonance</a>

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov99/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 7: Envelopes, Gates &amp; Triggers</a><br>
       You press a key on your synth. It plays a note. That's it, right? Wrong.
       Gordon Reid explains the role of envelopes, triggers, and gates in this
       deceptively simple process.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec99/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 8: More About Envelopes</a><br>
       Gordon Reid reveals some of the limitations of the 'classic' ADSR
       envelope with reference to a practical synthesis example, and explains
       some of the different types of envelopes found on 'classic' analogue
       synths, from AR envelopes right up to highly flexible digitally
       controlled EGs.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan00/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 9: An Introduction To VCAs</a>

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb00/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 10: Modulation</a> <br>
       In this month's instalment of his series on the basics of subtractive
       synthesis, Gordon Reid considers the magic ingredient that makes all the
       other elements sound interesting... 

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar00/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 11: Amplitude Modulation</a><br>
       Last month, Gordon Reid examined the concept of modulation at low
       frequencies. This month, he speeds things up a bit. The result is not
       just faster versions of the same modulation effects, but a new type of
       synthesis...

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr00/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 12: An Introduction To Frequency Modulation</a><br>
       As Gordon Reid explained last month, audio-frequency modulation of the
       amplitude of a signal can be a powerful synthesis tool. The
       possibilities expand still further when we consider what happens when
       you use one audio-frequency signal to modulate the frequency of another

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may00/articles/synth.htm">Part 13: More On Frequency Modulation</a><br>
       Last month, we examined the frankly scary maths allowing you to predict
       the audible effects of Frequency Modulation. This month, although the
       maths gets even tougher, Gordon Reid relates the theory to the practical
       implementation of FM synthesis on Yamaha's digital synths, as well as
       modular and non-modular analogues

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun00/articles/synthsec.htm">Part 14: An Introduction To Additive Synthesis</a><br>
       Every pitched sound can be thought of as a collection of individual sine
       waves at frequencies related to the fundamental. Gordon Reid introduces
       a powerful method of synthesis that works by manipulating these
       individual harmonics.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul00/articles/synthsec.htm">Part 15: An Introduction To ESPS And Vocoders</a><br>
       Gordon Reid turns his attention to the effects that can be achieved when
       subtractive synthesis components are applied not to the output from
       oscillators, but to real-world sounds -- such as human speech.


  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug00/articles/synthsec.htm">Part 16: From Sample And Hold To Sample-rate Converters (1)</a><br>
       Gordon Reid introduces the synthesis modules that allow you to create a
       number of commonly used 'random' effects, and their close relatives --
       analogue sequencers.


  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep00/articles/synthsec.htm">Part 17: From Sample And Hold To Sample-rate Converters (2)</a>

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct00/articles/synthsec.htm">Part 18: Priorities And Triggers</a><br>
       In these days of 64-note polyphony and 32-part multitimbrality, it's
       easy to forget the importance of note-priority systems in analogue
       monosynths -- yet they can have a drastic effect on what you hear when
       you play or trigger an old synth. Gordon Reid provides a refresher
       course

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov00/articles/synthsec.htm">Part 19: Duophony</a><br>
       Gordon Reid discovers that two's company, as he investigates how
       manufacturers stretched the capabilities of analogue monosynths to offer
       the magnificent total of two notes at a time...

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec00/articles/synthsec.asp">Part 20 Introducing Polyphony</a><br>
       Having explored the way monophonic and duophonic analogue keyboards
       work, Gordon Reid puts away his Minimoog and Odyssey and descends into
       the complex world of polyphonic synths to a flourish of complex jazz
       chords.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan01/articles/synthsec.asp">Part 21 From Polyphony To Digital Synths</a><br>
       Polyphony is hard to achieve on analogue synths without incurring hideous
       expense. This month, Gordon Reid explains how synth manufacturers employed
       digital technology to overcome this problem.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb01/articles/synthsecrets.asp">Part 22: From Springs, Plates &amp; Buckets to Physical Modellin </a><br>
       Onboard effects may seem like a relatively recent synth innovation, but
       even old modular synths offered analogue effects. Although they were
       basic, the freely patchable nature of modular synths allowed them to be
       used to create convincing acoustic instrument sounds . thus effectively
       physical modelling. Gordon Reid explains how.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar01/articles/synthsec.asp">Part 23: Formant Synthesis</a>

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr01/articles/synthsecrets.asp">Part 24: Synthesizing Wind Instruments</a><br>
       Gordon Reid embarks on a journey to synthesize convincing woodwind and brass. This month, he considers how these instruments make their sounds in real life.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may01/articles/synthsecrets.asp">Part 25: Synthesizing Brass Instruments</a><br>
      Gordon Reid builds on the acoustic theory of wind and brass instruments he introduced last month, and explains how to produce a convincing analogue trumpet sound.


  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun01/articles/synthsecrets.pt26.asp">Part 26: Brass Synthesis On A Minimoog</a><br>
       Last month we looked at how analogue modules can reproduce the sound of a
       real trumpet. All very well if you own a wall-sized modular system . but
       what if your means are more limited? Gordon Reid adapts theory to practice
       with a Minimoog

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul01/articles/synthsecrets27.asp">Part 27: Roland SH101/ARP Axxe Brass Synthesis</a><br>
       Gordon Reid concludes his attempts to adapt an idealised analogue brass
       patch so that it can be programmed on real synths. This month, he looks at
       the Roland SH101 and ARP Axxe.



  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug01/articles/synthsecrets28.asp">Part 28: Synthesizing Plucked Strings</a><br>
        Having dealt exhaustively with the mechanics of brass instruments and how
        to go about synthesizing them, Gordon Reid turns to instruments that use
        plucked strings to generate their sound, taking the complexities of the
        acoustic guitar as an example...



  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep01/articles/synthsecrets29.asp">Part 29: The Theoretical Acoustic Guitar Patch</a><br>
       Having explained last month the reasons why analogue synthesis of guitar
       sounds should be well-nigh impossible, Gordon Reid puts the theory to
       the test...


  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct01/articles/synthsecrets30.asp">Part 30: A Final Attempt To Synthesize Guitars</a><br>
       Having proved that subtractive synthesis of an acoustic guitar is
       completely impractical, Gordon Reid tries his hand at the electric
       variety, and deconstructs some past attempts to emulate the sound via
       analogue means.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov01/articles/synthsecrets1101.asp">Part 31: Synthesizing Percussion</a><br>
       Synth Secrets turns its attention to the synthesis of percussion instruments, beginning with pitched drums

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec01/articles/synthsecrets1201.asp">Part 32: Practical Percussion Synthesis</a>

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan02/articles/synthsecrets0102.asp">Part 33: Synthesizing Drums: The Bass Drum</a><br>
        Ever wanted to synthesize unpitched membranophones? No? Well, you might
        if you knew that bass and snare drums are of this percussion type. We
        show you how


  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb02/articles/synthsecrets0202.asp">Part 34: Practical Bass Drum Synthesis</a><br>
       Moving from last month's theoretical bass drum synth patch to its
       practical application on affordable analogue synths, we also take a look
       at how the world's most famous drum machines produce this fundamental
       rhythm sound.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar02/articles/synthsecrets0302.asp">Part 35: Synthesizing Drums: The Snare Drum</a><br>
       If you thought synthesizing realistic bass drums was complex, that's
       nothing compared to snares. So how is it that the analogue snare sound
       is so well known? And how do you go about creating it? We find out...

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr02/articles/synthsecrets0402.asp">Part 36: Practical Snare Drum Synthesis</a><br>
       Last month, we revealed just how hideously complex the sound-producing
       mechanism of the snare drum can be. Nevertheless, synthesizing the sound
       is not as hard as it seems, as we find out with the aid of a Roland
       SH101...

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may02/articles/synthsecrets0502.asp">Part 37: Analysing Metallic Percussion</a>

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun02/articles/synthsecrets0602.asp">Part 38: Synthesizing Realistic Cymbals</a>


  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul02/articles/synthsecrets0702.asp">Part 39: Practical Cymbal Synthesis</a>

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug02/articles/synthsecrets0802.asp">Part 40: Synthesizing Bells</a><br>
       Having come up last month with a reasonably realistic cymbal patch, it's
       time to take the principles of synthesizing metallic percussion one
       stage further, and produce bell sounds. But there's more to this than
       you might think


  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep02/articles/synthsecrets09.asp">Part 41: Synthesizing Cowbells &amp; Claves</a><br>
       Having learned last month how to synthesize tuned bells, we turn this
       month, in the last of this series on the subject of percussion, to
       untuned bells -- in the form of the humble cowbell -- and claves.

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct02/articles/synthsecrets10.asp">Part 42: Synthesizing Pianos</a><br>
       Surely the only convincing synth pianos are sample-based ones? A sound as
       rich and expressive as that of an acoustic piano is far too complex to be
       rendered by subtractive synthesis... isn't it? We find out...

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/synthsecrets1102.asp">Part 43: Synthesizing Acoustic Pianos On The Roland JX10</a><br>
       As explained last month, synthesizing the sound of an acoustic piano is
       difficult, but it can be done reasonably realistically, as the
       1986-vintage Roland JX10 shows. We find out how Roland managed it...

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec02/articles/synthsecrets1202.asp">Part 44: Synthesizing Acoustic Pianos On The Roland JX10</a><br>
       How did they make that sound on a subtractive synth? We continue to
       dissect the analogue 'Acoustic Piano' Perfomance from Roland's
       1986-vintage JX10

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan03/articles/synthsecrets0103.asp">Part 45: Synthesizing Acoustic Pianos On The Roland JX10</a><br>
       When trying to copy a real piano with an analogue synth, if one patch
       doesn't quite do it, two just might...

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Feb03/articles/synthsecrets46.asp">Part 46: Synthesizing Strings: String Machines</a><br>
       Analogue synths can't synthesize every sound, but the attempts made to
       replicate the sound of orchestral strings were so successful that
       so-called string machines became much-loved instruments in their own
       right. We begin a voyage into the world of synthesized strings...
        
  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Mar03/articles/synthsecrets47.asp">Part 47: Synthesizing Strings, PWM &amp; String Sounds</a><br>
       Pulse-width modulation is a vital tool in achieving lush-sounding
       synthesized string pads . so what if your synth doesn't have it? Fear
       not . for PWM can itself be synthesized. Here's how...

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr03/articles/synthsecrets48.asp">Part 48: Synthesizing Bowed Strings: the Violin family</a><br>
       Following our success at synthesizing the sound of analogue string
       machines, we hone our techniques with a view to recreating the sound of
       the real thing

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/May03/articles/synthsecrets49.asp">Part 49: Practical Bowed-string Synthesis</a><br>
       Having looked at the mechanics of how a bowed string instrument
       generates its sound last month, it's time to put these principles into
       practice, using nothing more complex than a miniKorg 700 monophonic
       synth...

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Jun03/articles/synthsecrets50.asp">Part 50: Practical Bowed-string Synthesis (continued </a><br>
       After putting all our bowed-string synthesis theory into practice on a
       Korg 700 last month, we found that the result was only acceptable as a
       string sound with a lot of wishful thinking. Can we improve on it?

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Jul03/articles/synthsecrets51.asp">Part 51: Articulation &amp; Bowed-string Synthesis</a><br>
       The skilful articulation of a synthesized string patch can improve it no
       end, even one created using very basic building blocks, as we saw at the
       end of last month. But we can take this approach much further...

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug03/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 52: Synthesizing Pan Pipes</a><br>
       The characteristic sound of flute-like instruments is complex . but
       fortunately not so complex that it can't be emulated fairly successfully
       with a synthesizer

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep03/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 53: Synthesizing Simple Flutes</a><br>
       The Monty Python team once famously claimed that being able to play the
       flute was a simple matter of 'blowing here, and moving your hands up and
       down here'. But there's a lot more to it than that...

  </li><li><a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct03/articles/synthsecrets.htm">Part 54: Practical Flute Synthesis</a><br>
       As we saw last month, there's much to synthesizing a convincing flute
       sound . and yet basic analogue monosynths have offered reasonable flute
       patches for 30 years. Surely the process can be simplified?
